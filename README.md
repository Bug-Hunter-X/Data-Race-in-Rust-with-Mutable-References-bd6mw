This repository demonstrates a common data race in Rust using mutable references.  The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  Data races can lead to unpredictable behavior and are a serious concern in concurrent programming.  This example highlights the importance of avoiding multiple mutable references to the same data without proper synchronization mechanisms.
